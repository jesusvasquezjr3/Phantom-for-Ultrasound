# Phantom-for-Ultrasound
Development of vascular phantoms simulating stenosis/aneurysms, evaluated via clinical ultrasound (B-mode/Doppler) to assess hemodynamic changes (turbulence, velocity shifts). Project at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey (courses BI2009B.663/BI2007B.663) focused on accessible educational tools for medical imaging training.
